## Functionality

* Chating with individual registered users and each chat having seen and delivered status. 
* Able to see online status of all users and if anyone when offline the last seen of user can be seen.
* Any user can be blocked which results in, you will not be able to send or receive any chat from that user and the user and you will not able to see the online or last seen of each other.
* Any user can be reported spam which result in first blocking the user and then removing it from user's list and putting it in spammed users of the database. The spammed user cannot be unspammed later.
* The seen and delivered status is shown with double tick and cyan double tick respectively.
* Groups can be formed with more than one user, so that chat can be broadcasted among the whole. 
* The person who forms the group becomes the admin and has right to dismiss or to make multiple admin. 
* Admin can't dismiss or remove a member who became admin before it.
* Admin can also add more members later once the group is formed.
* A blocked user who is admin can't add members who blocked it.
* For each group chat the seen count, delivered count can be seen and who and when it is delivered to or seen by can be displayed. 
* The chat window shows only limited chats to see more chats scroll upwards.
